# WooCommerce Product Template

Super simple plugin to add custom product template feature to WooCommece. If you don't have any custom product template then you won't see **Product Template** metabox. And to create a custom product template you have to create a custom page template using the following file header.

``` php
<?php
/**
 * Template Name: WC Product Template
 * Template Post Type: product
 */
```

### Template Selection Metabox
